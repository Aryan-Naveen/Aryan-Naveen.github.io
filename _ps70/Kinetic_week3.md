## Assignment Overview

This week's task was to create a kinetic sculpture that incorporates circuitry, including a motor and a power source, to enable movement. The sculpture was to be documented with a video or gif.

## Kinetic Sculpture Design

- **Concept:** For my kinetic sculpture, I designed a 4-bar linkage, inspired by the linkages involved in my final project. The design aimed to explore the mechanical movement and dynamics of linkages.

- **Challenges:** During the assembly, I encountered complexities such as the weight of the screws and the overall balance of the sculpture, which were not fully accounted for in the initial design.

- **CAD Design:** Below is the CAD image of the 4-bar linkage:

## Documentation

- **Video/GIF:** I recorded the movement of the sculpture and below is a gif capturing the kinetic movement:

## Reflection and Future Improvements

- **Stability and Balance:** In future iterations, I would emphasize the stability and balance of the sculpture. This includes considering the distribution of weight and ensuring that the linkage operates smoothly without tipping or wobbling.

- **Rigidity:** Enhancing the rigidity of the structure would prevent unwanted flexing and ensure consistent movement. This could involve using more robust materials or reinforcing critical joints.

- **Design Iterations:** Iterative testing and refinement would be crucial to achieving a well-balanced and functional kinetic sculpture.
