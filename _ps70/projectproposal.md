excerpt: "Interested in developing a system that can help improve the overall organization of my dorm room. An immediate example of such a device would potentially be a **laundry folding robot**."
---

The foundational theme for my potential final project is **organization**. Inherently I find myself to be quite messy and frequnetly this impedes the effeciency of certain activities. However, I hypothesize several of these chores can be offloaded to a system I design that can effectively and reliably perform them for me with minimal supervision. 

Final Project Idea #1: Laundry Folding Robot
======

There have been several examples of these systems throughout the internet. Inspired largely by shirt folding boards, I hypothesize that I could actuate the joints and produce a system that is able to effeciently fold my laundry. Additionally, I can take this project in several interesting directions including: (1) design a way to interface the system with my dresser directly (2) untangle potentially crumped clothing. Overall this could be a fun project that has direct utility in my daily life.

Above link is inspiration for potential build. In terms of integration into my current dresser, I am thinking I can design the system to automatically store the clothes in containment units that I can directly slide into my dresser.

Final Project Idea #2: Desk Organizer 
======

I have been curious about designing a system that potentially organizes my desk for me. In particular I would be curious to focus on designing some sort of robotic cable management system. The idea could be a hidden system that when activated (potentially through voice commands) will dispense the exact cable I am requesting, and then subsequently when I am finished will retract that cable and store it neatly for future. Additionally features I'd love to integrate include a method of easily adding/removing cables and overall ease of working with.
