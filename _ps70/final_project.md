## Project Overview

My final project involved constructing a clothes folding robot using a double linkage system. The robot is equipped with three actuated flaps designed to fold various types of clothing efficiently. 

## Robot Design

- **Construction:** The robot utilizes a double linkage system with three actuated flaps to fold clothes.
- **Functionality:** The robot can fold different types of clothing, including t-shirts, dress shirts, shorts, and pants.

## Specific Features

### Double Linkage System

The double linkage system was a critical component of the robot's design. I extensively prototyped different link lengths and positions to optimize performance. The system was designed to allow easy modifications without needing to completely remake parts.

A challenge I encountered was the forces exerted on the links, which caused several to break. This was an oversight in the early design phase.

### Wiring and Circuitry

Ensuring robust and clean wiring was imperative for portability. While wiring servos and buttons is relatively straightforward, I created a compact board for the wiring.
