## Project Overview

My final project involved constructing a clothes folding robot using a double linkage system. The robot is equipped with three actuated flaps designed to fold various types of clothing efficiently. 

## Robot Design

- **Construction:** The robot utilizes a double linkage system with three actuated flaps to fold clothes.
- **Functionality:** The robot can fold different types of clothing, including t-shirts, dress shirts, shorts, and pants.

## Video Demonstrations

Below is a gallery of video demonstrations showcasing the robot folding various types of clothes:
