## Project Overview

My final project involved constructing a clothes folding robot using a double linkage system. The robot is equipped with three actuated flaps designed to fold various types of clothing efficiently. 

## Robot Design

- **Construction:** The robot utilizes a double linkage system with three actuated flaps to fold clothes.
- **Functionality:** The robot can fold different types of clothing, including t-shirts, dress shirts, shorts, and pants.

## Specific Features

### Double Linkage System

The double linkage system was a critical component of the robot's design. I extensively prototyped different link lengths and positions to optimize performance. The system was designed to allow easy modifications without needing to completely remake parts.

A challenge I encountered was the forces exerted on the links, which caused several to break. This was an oversight in the early design phase.

Below is a GIF showing the linkage in action:

### Wiring and Circuitry

Ensuring robust and clean wiring was imperative for portability. While wiring servos and buttons is relatively straightforward, I created a compact board for the wiring.

## Overall Assembly

I think the biggest growth in this course was my ability to CAD and design complex systems. Below is a screenshot of the overall assembly modeled in Fusion:

In particular, I want to highlight the connecting mechanisms I leveraged to assemble this robot primarily using laser cut pieces.

- **Finger Joints:** The base frame of the robot is constructed using finger joints to allow the pieces to naturally slot in appropriate spots.

- **3D printed brackets:** Throughout the assembly I additionally designed custom brackets leveraging the triangle pattern of the frame to allow for easy mounting.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated the robot's ability to fold various clothing items. Future improvements could include enhancing the speed and precision of the folding process.
