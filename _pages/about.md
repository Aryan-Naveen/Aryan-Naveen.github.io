I am passionate about **advancing the intelligence and decision-making capabilities of autonomous systems to enable generalist behaviors across diverse environments**. My research integrates tools from machine learning, optimization, and representation learning to address challenges in **spatial perception, navigation, and control**. I aim to bridge the gap between robotics research and impactful real-world solutions, with the ultimate goal of enabling autonomous agents to reason and act intelligently across a wide range of tasks.

I am an undergraduate student at Harvard University working with [Prof. Robert J. Wood](https://seas.harvard.edu/person/robert-wood) and [Prof. Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/). I am currently in the process of applying to graduate studies for advanced studies in robotics intelligence.
